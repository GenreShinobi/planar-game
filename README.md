# Planar Development Roadmap
In this repository, you can find the official Planar Development Roadmap. Our development roadmap is where you can learn about what features are being worked on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to release them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the Planar Discord or share your feedback via the Issue Tracker.

The roadmap repository is for communicating Planar's roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and interaction limits are in place. I plan to iterate on the format of the roadmap in time as I see potential for increased engagement and more discussion about the future of Planar. 

# Guide to the Roadmap
Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following: 
* A **release phase** that indicates the current phase of the feature, for the full ist of phases, see below.
* Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap, the issue will be closed, and it will be moved to the appropriate release column. 

# Submit Feedback or Bug Reports
I want to hear your suggestions, to suggest new features, changes to an existing feature, or to report an issue please open a New Issue and explain in as much detail as possible. 

# Release Phases
* **exploring:** <br>
Feature is currently under consideration. I am considering the feature, researching it's potential, and gathering feedback.

Features that are mostly complete, requires the user be opted into beta features. Bug fixes will be prioritized.
